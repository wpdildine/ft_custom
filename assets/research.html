		<p>A little boy: wandering, running, spinning, very few words, little ability to play, and diagnosed with autism at 2 ½. At 3 ½, with support in a community program, he still didn’t interact much.
		<p>Participation in a single subject research study introduced the family to Floortime: four 45-minute sessions/week of Floortime for 7 weeks and a few short family sessions at home daily.  The Results? 
		<p>After only 7 weeks of Floortime training, the child’s communications were more spontaneous; his playtime more pleasurable, both initiating it and inventing new games; and everyone’s stress lessened. The increase in interaction was highly statistically significant.

		<h2>About Floortime Research</h2>
		<p>Floortime is an evidence-based intervention. The research evidence demonstrates that it strengthens fundamental communication and relationship abilities for children with autism. These improvements in the core deficits occur because of Floortime’s foundation in child development The links below provide articles on both the efficacy of Floortime and on developmental interventions in general.
