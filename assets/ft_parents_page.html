		<p>The interactive, online manual uses short video excerpts from Dr. Greenspan to break down the steps of Floortime, and it demonstrates them in three types of play. It gives detailed techniques and practical information for implementing Floortime. It has an extensive section to help with problems you might encounter while doing Floortime plus many tips and insights.
