		<p class="text-primary"> The genius of the late Dr. Stanley Greenspan has transformed the lives of countless children throughout the world.</p>
		<p>As a theoretician, diagnostician, and clinician, he redefined the understanding of child development—that is, how infants, young children and adolescents feel and think—guiding parents, professionals and researchers. He was the world’s foremost authority on clinical work with infants and young children with developmental and emotional problems. His ideas will continue to improve the lives of children for generations to come.</p>

		<p class="text-info">My 3 year old boy was regressing and falling away from everyone especially his therapists. I was told he was autistic and retarded. We made a family commitment to Floortime and saw amazing and immediate results. All I wanted was a child who would not be isolated completely. What I have, because of Floortime, is so much more. He is an 8 year old with friends, fully conversational and keeping up with his peers in a general education classroom.</p>
