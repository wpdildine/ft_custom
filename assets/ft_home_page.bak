				<h1>Our Program</h1>
				<h3>Children with developmental delays, including those on the autism spectrum, struggle to relate, be understood, and interact. </h3>
				<p>Floortime was created and designed by Dr. Stanley Greenspan to address these needs. Through Floortime, you can form a close relationship with a child, improve communication, and help him or her develop self-control. Floortime makes a big difference in children’s lives—and in their parents’ lives.<p> <a href="../content/about-our-program" class="btn btn-material-light-blue-A400">Learn More</a>

				<h3>A little boy: wandering, running, spinning, very few words, little ability to play, and diagnosed with autism at 2 ½. At 3 ½, with support in a community program, he still didn’t interact much.</h3>
				<p>Participation in a single subject research study introduced the family to Floortime: four 45-minute sessions/week of Floortime for 7 weeks and a few short family sessions at home daily.  The Results? <p><a href="../content/research" class="btn btn-material-yellow-700">Learn More</a>
