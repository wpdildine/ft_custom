		<p><strong>How do we develop?</strong>
		Understanding Developmental Challenges: This section sets the basic framework for how emotional, cognitive, social, and motor functioning fit together.</p>

		<p><strong>Can your children improve?</strong>
		Understanding Your Child’s Challenges: This section explains the process of observing your child and identifying your child’s individual developmental challenges. Children are not their diagnosis.</p>

		<p><strong>What can you do?</strong>
		Working through Challenges: This section gives you Floortime principles on how to help your child learn to communicate, relate, and overcome their weaknesses.</p>

		<p><strong>What is the research behind Floortime?</strong>
		Research Results and Outcomes: This section describes several studies that show significant improvements from Floortime.</p>

		<p>Each of these four sections is broken up into 4 or 5 video clips. Many are examples of Dr. Greenspan working with parents. The video clips average 20 minutes each, and the total time is 6 hours. Each lecture and demonstration is available as an individual, on-demand video to watch as you wish. If you complete the short evaluation at the end of the course, your suggestions will help us to improve the course. We would greatly appreciate this assistance to make the course as useful to parents as possible.</p>
