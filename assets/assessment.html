        <strong><em>The Greenspan Assessment</em></strong>, developed by Dr. Stanley Greenspan and Jake Greenspan, has
        two parts, a
        developmental questionnaire and a sensory questionnaire. It applies to children with autism and the
        accompanying developmental challenges. Why is it important? Even with the same diagnosis children have
        different challenges and strengths. A child who struggles with paying attention may find the world
        overwhelming, too noisy, too fast moving; another child struggling with the same issue may find the world
        too dull and understimulating. Same problem, very different intervention. The first child needs a calmer,
        slowed down world; the second needs a more energized world. Knowing your child’s profile—in this case,
        whether a child needs a calm and patient “tortoise” parent or an energized and animated “hare” parent—is
        critically important.</p>

        <h2>The Greenspan Questionnaires</h2>

        <p>These questionnaires were initially developed by Stanley Greenspan MD and Jake Greenspan for parents. The
            questionnaires’ benchmark is standard, normative behavior. To test the reliability of the parents’ answers,
            their scores were compared to Dr. Greenspan’s. In all three groups of children—those with Autistic Spectrum
            Disorder, those with Regulatory Disorder, and those functioning optimally—the parents’ scores were similar
            to Dr. Greenspan’s, with no more than a one-point difference in a few instances and some .5
            differences. </p>
