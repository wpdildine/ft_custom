		<p>For parents, we offer a tool to help you evaluate your child's strengths and weaknesses and track their progress.</p>
		<p>The Assessment has two parts:</p>
		<p><strong>The Developmental Questionnaire</strong> focuses on emotional and intellectual abilities.</p>
		<p><strong>The Sensory Processing Questionnaire</strong> focuses on how children process and regulate what they see, hear, touch, smell, and taste, and how they move.</p>

		<h2>What Is The Greenspan Assessment?</h2>
		<p>The Greenspan Assessment is a tool developed by Dr. Stanley Greenspan and Jake Greenspan that helps you learn how <strong>your child</strong> processes information from the world around them. The two questionnaires provide you with a baseline profile of your child’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>			
		<p>The questionnaires have straightforward and easy-to-answer questions. They are<strong> available to take year-round, as many times as you like.</strong></p>
		<p>A chart at the end displays the results and an interpretation of the results. The results chart lets you <strong>track changes</strong> over time, so you can see how your child improves with various interventions.</p>

		<h2>Identify and Understand Your Child’s Developmental Profile</h2>
		<p>All children with special needs have developmental milestones that need improvement, no matter the diagnosis. And even with the same diagnosis children have different challenges and weaknesses.</p>
		A child who struggles with attending and communicating may find the world overwhelming, too noisy, too fast moving; another child struggling with the same issues may find the world too dull and understimulating. <strong>Same symptom, very different intervention.</strong> The first child needs a calmer, slower world; the other needs a more energized world. Both children need the world to embrace them where they are biologically.</p>
		<p><strong>Knowing your child’s developmental profile</strong>—-in this case, whether a child needs a calm and patient "tortoise" parent or an energized and animated "hare" parent —- is of critical importance.</p>
		<p>When your child has a stumbling block in development, regardless of the reason, it is unlikely to get better on its own. The more information you have, the better equipped you will be to understand your child's development and support them in overcoming challenges.</p>
